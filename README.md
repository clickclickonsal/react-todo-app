# react-todo-app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Refer to this link [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) for the create-react-app documentation.

This is a simple React todo app that I built for a React Workshop that I did.
It's heavly commented to aim at being a helpful guide to people just gettting into React. ðŸ˜„
